# that y is dependent and x is independent. Instead we say that, x1 and x2 are the features cummulatively used to describe the data labelled as y_i.
# Here, instead of y, see it as x2. y_hat_i is the predicted label for np.sign(w.dot(x_i)) and y_i is the ground-truth label for x_i
# w.dot(x) = 0

#  y = mx + c is the decision boundary
# y - mx - c = 0 is the decision boundary, m = -1*w[1], c = -1*w[0] => m = (-1*w[1])/w[2], c = (-1*w[0])/w[2]

# For a particular x_i, if w.dot(x_i) > 0, then y_hat = +1
#                     , if w.dot(x_i) = 0, then x_i is a point which falls on the decision boundary itelf,
#                       and decision boundary is a NO MAN'S LAND. Therefore, x_i neither belongs to class +1 or class -1
#                       y_hat = 0
#                     , if w.dot(x_i) < 0, then y_hat = -1

# This is referred to as the sign function. In numpy, we use it as np.sign(w.dot(x_i)


# Perceptron Model says that:
    # w and w_old initialized to zero. Remember w is a vector
    # For any training example x_i,
        # if   np.sign(w.dot(x_i)) is not equal to y_i (the ground-truth label) i.e., y_hat for that particular x_i ! = y_i
        # then update the weights with w = w + learning_rate * y_i * x_i (Here, we are adding to the weight as opposed to what we did in Linear Regression. Also in
        # Linear Regression, weights were updated only once per iteration. Here, they are update once for every training example if the condition is met.)

    # Do the above for EACH or ALL of the training example x_i
