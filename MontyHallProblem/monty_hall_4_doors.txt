Door No. 1 2 3 4
Prize	 0 0 1 0

Case 1: You don't change the door:
You would win if and only if you had chosen the door with the car.
P(winning) = 1/4 = 25%

Case 2: You change the door:
You would win if initially you had chosen the door with a goat behind it.
P(initially you had chosen the door with a goat behind it) = 3/4

AND

You choose a door with prize behind it out of the two
P = 1/2

P = (1/2)*(3/4) = 3/8

1/8 = 12.5 percent
3/8 = 37.5 percent

P = 37.5%

37.5% > 25%
Therefore, its better to switch.
